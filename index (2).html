     <h1><b><u>This website is made from HTML code</u></b></h1>
     <hr>
     <p>This website is a simple project.This project is made by a beginner.I have experience coding with python, but
     I never actually learnt HTML, that is why this project is going to be basic and have no fancy stuff just a photo.
     I created this project using HTML because it was hard to make a website using python, that's what I thought personally.
     That is why I made a website using HTML.I have about probably some months of experience with Python and almost no
     experience with HTML.I have tried to make many websites by now that I have lost count, cannot lie but making websites
     is actually easy but making them local is so hard to me.Every time I tried to make it local so other people can
     see it, I failed, every time.So I thought why not just make a website with HTML only.So that is why I made this
     website.Making my first website which people can view is a huge step for me in the programming world.</p>

     <p>So, many people don't know what is a coding language.So why do we use coding languages, the purpose of coding languages is to
     create things that are going to be viewed by people around the whole world, you can also make a project
     that only you can view.For this project I used HTML a Hyper text markup language, that is the short
     form of HTML.There are many coding languages, one better than another.</p>

     <h2><b><u>The next coding language I would like to learn</u></b></h2>

     <p>So when it comes to the topic of learning a new coding language, it might be hard but after a while
     it probably will become easy.I made this website from seeing many tutorials.At the end I went basic
     for my first HTML project.It was not hard making this website, but publishing this website was very hard.</p>

     <p>I would like to give a thank you to all of you who viewed my work and I hope you liked the
     website.Thank you! And I will be coding more projects.After I published this website I probably have learned a little about HTML.
     By the way there is a photo beneath, I just randomly decided to add this picture to my project.</p>
